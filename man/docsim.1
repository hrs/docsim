.TH DOCSIM 1
.SH NAME
docsim \- score similarity between text documents
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B docsim
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fB\-\-query \fIFILE\fR [\fIPATH\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B docsim
compares one file (the \fIquery\fR) with every other text file in the current
directory and sorts them according to their textual similarity.
.PP
docsim's default behavior is parse the words out of each file (including the
query), pass them through a stoplist to remove common English words, remove
suffixes from each word with Porter stemming, perform TF-IDF to weight terms
within the document and within the corpus, and report the cosine simularity
between every document and the query.
.PP
docsim works best with English documents, since the included stoplist and
stemming algorithm both operate on English words.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-\-best\-first
When enabled, docsim will sort results from best to worst, instead of the
default (worst to best).
.TP
.BR \-\-limit " " \fINUM\fR
Show no more that the best NUM results.
.TP
.BR \-\-no\-stemming
Don't stem words. Stemming reduces inflected words to their word stem before
comparing documents, which maps morphologically related words to a common term
(so "spinning", "spinner", and "spins" might all map to "spin").
.PP
.RS
Stemming usually improves scoring accuracy in English, but should probably be
disabled when searching across code or documents in other languages.
.RE
.TP
.BR \-\-no\-stoplist
Don't filter out common words, like "the" and "because".
.TP
.BR \-\-omit\-query
Don't include the query document itself in the results, even if it's in a
directory being searched.
.TP
.BR \-\-show\-scores
Include the cosine similarity between each document and the query in the results.
.TP
.BR \-\-verbose
Print extra debugging information.
